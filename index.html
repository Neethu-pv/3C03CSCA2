    Early in 1964,the enlightened public of Kanhangad and Nileshwar resolved to honour the memory  of <b>Jawaharlal Nehru</b>,the architect of modern India by undertakingeducational and cultura activities in this educationally backward area. In pursuit of this idea,a dedicated and learned team set up in1966,an educational society known as  <b>"The Nehru Memorial Education Society"</b> under the destinguished presidentship of the late <i>Shri. C. K. Nair</i> following which the society was duly registered.The establishment  of  <b>Nehru Arts And Science College,Kanhangad</b> in this backward coastal  tract was the major task the society had set before themselves and had subsequently accomplished it.

  The society acquired a plot of 30 <i>acres</i> at Padnekkad and applied for affiliation to the University of Kerala for a junior college in the locality. The foundation stone of the college  building was laid on 1<sup>st</sup> April 1968 by Late <i>Janab. C. H.
